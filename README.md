# flockjs
Simple collaborative coding for JS learning
There is a **on-line demo** deployment available at: https://flockjs.herokuapp.com 

### Running the server

To run the server, just use:

```
npm install 
npm start
```

Then, if running in localhost, you start a new room: `http://localhost:8080/`
